📋 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create a web-based AR experience where users can view furniture items in their real-world environment using Augmented Reality (AR).
This helps customers to visualize how furniture will look and fit in their space before making a purchase decision.

🚀 Project Description
Built a responsive website that allows users to interact with 3D models of furniture.

Integrated Augmented Reality (AR) using Google's <model-viewer> library.

Users can rotate, zoom, and place furniture models like chairs, tables, and sofas into their real environment using their smartphone or AR-supported devices.

Added environment customization like skyboxes and light settings to improve realism.
